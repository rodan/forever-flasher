'forever' blinker circuit - based on vk2zay's video [1]

most of the parts are 0805, including the led. power can come either from a 12mm coin cell Li (CR1220, CR1225) or a 1.5 battery.
in case the Li battery is used you should break the traces that go to the 2 pin external connector and use the now unconnected 2 holes to fasten the circuit to anything you want.



digikey part numbers:
    12mm battery holder:  3000KCT-ND
    BC847BPN:             568-1634-1-ND
